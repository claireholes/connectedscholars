Abstract: As scientists turn to social media for public communication and scientific collaboration, we use results from a large-scale census of faculty at land-grant universities across the United States to examine the current social media uses and attitudes of science faculty. A regression analysis reveals that attitudes towards social media, perceived university engagement climate, and personal motivations are among significant predictors of engaged social media use among science faculty. Implications of these findings are discussed.
