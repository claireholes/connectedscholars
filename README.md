This paper is a submission to the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication conference. This paper started as a project for a previous regression class I took last semester and I have continued to develop for this conference.


Abstract: Using a large-scale census of faculty at 46 land-grant universities across the United States, this study examined the effects of social media and engagement-related factors on the frequency of tenured-track science faculty?s social media use. Results from the multiple regression model revealed that: attitudes towards social media and self-efficacy surrounding engagement were positive predictors of frequency of social media use. Furthermore, the relationship between social media and engagement-related factors and frequency of social media use was influenced by faculty?s tenure status, field of work, age, and gender. Implications and limitations of these findings were discussed.
