# Connected Scholars Project 

This paper has been adapted from an extended abstract submission to the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication conference. Due to dataset complications, this proposal has been re-worked for the Spring 2020 PS 811 course at UW-Madison taught by Michael DeCrescenzo.


Abstract: As scientists turn to social media for public communication and scientific collaboration, we use results from a large-scale census of faculty at land-grant universities across the United States to examine the current social media uses and attitudes of science faculty. A regression analysis reveals that attitudes towards social media, perceived university engagement climate, and personal motivations are among significant predictors of engaged social media use among science faculty. Implications of these findings are discussed.
